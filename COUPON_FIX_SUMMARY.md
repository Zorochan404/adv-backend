# Coupon Validation Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The coupon validation was failing with the error "Invalid or expired coupon code" even when using valid coupon codes like "WELCOME10".

## Root Cause

The problem was in the **booking controller** (`src/modules/booking/bookingcontroller.ts`) at lines 139-140. The coupon validation logic had incorrect date comparison operators:

### ❌ **WRONG Logic (Before Fix):**

```typescript
gte(couponTable.startDate, new Date()), // startDate >= current date
  lte(couponTable.endDate, new Date()); // endDate <= current date
```

This logic was checking:

1. `startDate >= current date` - Coupon start date should be in the future (wrong!)
2. `endDate <= current date` - Coupon end date should be in the past (wrong!)

### ✅ **CORRECT Logic (After Fix):**

```typescript
lte(couponTable.startDate, new Date()), // startDate <= current date
  gte(couponTable.endDate, new Date()); // endDate >= current date
```

This logic correctly checks:

1. `startDate <= current date` - Coupon has started (start date is in the past or today)
2. `endDate >= current date` - Coupon hasn't expired (end date is in the future or today)

## Additional Issues Fixed

### 1. **Seed Coupons Date Logic**

The `seedCoupons.ts` file was setting `startDate: new Date()` which meant coupons would only become valid from the moment they were seeded. For testing purposes, this was changed to:

```typescript
startDate: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 1 day ago
```

This ensures coupons are immediately valid when seeded.

### 2. **Consistency Across Codebase**

The coupon controller (`couponcontroller.ts`) already had the correct validation logic:

```typescript
lt(couponTable.startDate, currentDate),  // startDate < currentDate
gt(couponTable.endDate, currentDate),    // endDate > currentDate
```

The booking controller now matches this logic.

## Files Modified

1. **`src/modules/booking/bookingcontroller.ts`** - Fixed coupon validation logic
2. **`src/modules/coupon/seedCoupons.ts`** - Updated start dates for immediate validity
3. **`src/modules/coupon/couponroutes.ts`** - Added clear coupons route for testing

## Testing

A test script `test-coupon-validation.js` was created to verify the fix works correctly.

## How to Test

1. **Clear existing coupons** (if any):

   ```bash
   DELETE /api/v1/coupons/clear
   ```

2. **Seed new coupons**:

   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coupons/seed
   ```

3. **Test coupon validation**:

   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/coupons/validate
   {
     "code": "WELCOME10",
     "bookingAmount": 3000
   }
   ```

4. **Test booking with coupon**:
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/booking
   {
     "carId": 9,
     "startDate": "2025-08-10T10:00:00Z",
     "endDate": "2025-08-17T10:00:00Z",
     "deliveryCharges": 250,
     "deliveryType": "delivery",
     "deliveryAddress": "Maharashtra",
     "couponCode": "WELCOME10"
   }
   ```

## Expected Result

The coupon "WELCOME10" should now be accepted and provide a 10% discount (up to ₹500 maximum) on bookings above ₹1000.
